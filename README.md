# Interactive 3D Box with Hover Effects and Sound

This project features an interactive 3D box that responds to mouse movement, with hover and click sound effects. The box's faces are individually animated, and a glowing border effect is applied to the box. It also includes particle effects that appear when the user moves their mouse.

## Features

- **3D Box Rotation**: The box rotates along the X and Y axes based on mouse movement.
- **Hover Effects**: Each face of the box has a hover effect that includes scaling and rotation.
- **Sound Effects**: 
  - A "Yay!" sound plays when hovering over the box.
  - A "Pop!" sound plays when the box is clicked.
- **Particle Effects**: Particles burst from the mouse position when it moves across the screen.
- **Glowing Box**: A glowing border effect surrounds the box, with dynamic animations.
